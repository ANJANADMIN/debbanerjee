# Bootstrap Notes
In this page I shall keep my notes about the Bootstrap framework.

1. The `.row` class has a default left and right margin of (-)15px.  
-Remember this before adding any `<p>` or any other element directly inside a `<div class="row"></div>`.  
-It seems that Bootstrap `.col-*-*` classes has a padding value of 15px to compensate this. (I have to check this.)  
2. `.Jumbotron` class has a big (30px) bottom margin.  
3. Aligning the `.social-block` div inside the Jumbrotron is pain in the a**. As a matter of fact, I am finding any kind of alignment very hard to understand. I have to understand the `float:` and `position:` properties of CSS very well.
